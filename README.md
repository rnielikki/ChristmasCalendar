# ChristmasCalendar Project!
... It was "Advent calendar" in english, whatever.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/LumiKwon0498/KouluAss/_apis/build/status/rnielikki.ChristmasCalendar?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/LumiKwon0498/KouluAss/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master)

## What is this?
This helps to make christmas calendar only with markdown file adding / editing.

### So what'll be title and what'll be content?
```
# Today is already second day.
I wonder if there're Santa Claus. Or is this Satan Claus?
Whatever, I am wating for the white winter.
```
Then title is: *Today is already second day.*
Content is:
```
<p>I wonder if there're Santa Claus. Or is this Satan Claus?</p>
<p>Whatever, I am wating for the white winter.</p>
```

And... the summary is:
*I wonder if there're Santa Claus. Or is this Satan Claus?
Whatever, I am wating ...*

## Why?
It's part of the software testing project, but also for trying blazor WASM!

## Can I see example?
Sorry, currently I have no subscription for this right now.

But I can leave link here, if you have an example!

## Why it's 1-25, not 1-24?
I made it, but I don't know. Maybe 5x5 looked beautiful?

## Can I contribute?
**Sure.** VVelcome!

## Any plan for this project in future?
Hopefully.
