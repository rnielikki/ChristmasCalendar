# ChristmasCalendar Project!

... It was "Advent calendar" in english, whatever.

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/LumiKwon0498/KouluAss/_apis/build/status/rnielikki.ChristmasCalendar?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/LumiKwon0498/KouluAss/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master)

## What is this?

This helps to make christmas calendar only with markdown file adding / editing.

### So what'll be title and what'll be content?

```markdown
# Today is already second day.
I wonder if there're Santa Claus. Or is this Satan Claus?
Whatever, I am wating for the white winter.
```

Then title is: *Today is already second day.*
Content is:

```html
<p>I wonder if there're Santa Claus. Or is this Satan Claus?</p>
<p>Whatever, I am wating for the white winter.</p>
```

And... the summary is:
*I wonder if there're Santa Claus. Or is this Satan Claus?
Whatever, I am wating ...*

## Why?

It's part of the software testing project, but also for trying blazor WASM!

## It's fully client-side, so you can foresee API data. It's not safe.

If someone wants spoiler, let them see it.

Also, you can set baseUri to `appsettings.json` file and define where is server-side data.

(For example, you can use Azure Function to hide unrevealed days ;) )

## Can I see example?

Maybe somedays!

## Why it's 1-25, not 1-24?

I made it, but I don't know. Maybe 5x5 looked beautiful?

## Can I contribute?

**Sure.** VVelcome!

## Any plan for this project in future?

Hopefully.
