## What is this

This helps to make advent calendar only with markdown file adding / editing.

### So, what is Advent calendar

Advent calendar is counting days until Christmas. Nowadays it starts in December, from day 1 to 24 (or 25, depending on the advent calendar / culture). Each day is covered and opened when reaches the day - it contains something, for example, any items or contents.

You can see more information about the Advent Calendar from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar).

### So what'll be title and what'll be content?

```
# Today is already second day.
I wonder if there're Santa Claus. Or is this Satan Claus?
Whatever, I am wating for the white winter.
```
Then title is: *Today is already second day.*
Content is:
`
<p>I wonder if there're Santa Claus. Or is this Satan Claus?</p>
<p>Whatever, I am wating for the white winter.</p>
`
And... the summary is:
*I wonder if there're Santa Claus. Or is this Satan Claus?
Whatever, I am wating ...*

## Why?
It's part of the software testing project, but also for trying blazor WASM!
