# ChristmasCalendar Project!

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/LumiKwon0498/KouluAss/_apis/build/status/rnielikki.ChristmasCalendar?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/LumiKwon0498/KouluAss/_build/latest?definitionId=3&branchName=master)

## What is this?
This helps to make christmas calendar only with markdown file adding / editing.

### So what'll be title and what'll be content?
```
# Today is already second day.
I wonder if there're Santa Claus. Or is this Satan Claus?
Whatever, I am wating for the white winter.
```
Then title is: *Today is already second day.*
Content is:
`
<p>I wonder if there're Santa Claus. Or is this Satan Claus?</p>
<p>Whatever, I am wating for the white winter.</p>
`
And... the summary is:
*I wonder if there're Santa Claus. Or is this Satan Claus?
Whatever, I am wating ...*

## Why?
It's part of the software testing project, but also for trying blazor WASM!
